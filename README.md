# Phylog Cache Coherence Analysis
This repository contains the [UPPAAL](https://uppaal.org/) models detailed in https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2019/10755/pdf/LIPIcs-ECRTS-2019-18.pdf and https://github.com/nsensfel/thesis.

The coproswi folder contains a tool and protocol descriptions making it possible to switch the cache coherence protocol in use by these models. To avoid having to compile it, the Jar of this tool can be downloaded from https://noot-noot.org/jar_dist/protocol_switcher_standalone.jar.
